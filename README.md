## 🧭 Why This Exists

Most ML tutorials skip the “why” and focus only on “how.” This repo is here to bridge that gap with:
- ✅ Intuitive visuals
- ✅ Hands-on code
- ✅ Real-world examples
- ✅ Interview-ready math explanations

## 🛣️ Suggested Learning Path

1. **Linear Algebra** – Understand the foundation: vectors, matrices, projections.
2. **Calculus** – Learn how models “learn” using gradients and optimization.
3. **Probability & Stats** – Build intuition for data uncertainty and statistical modeling.
4. **Optimization** – Dive deeper into how models optimize their parameters.

## 📌 Who is this for?

- Data Scientists & ML Engineers preparing for interviews
- Students seeking solid mathematical intuition
- Anyone tired of just using `sklearn` as a black box

## 💡 How to Use

Just clone the repo and open the notebooks in Jupyter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bob24/mathematica.git
cd mathematica
jupyter notebook
```
